Orso Privacy Policy
Effective date: July 29, 2021

Rahul ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Orso Chrome Extension.

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

How do we access your data?
We access the data you provide us with which is strictly necessary in order to make the application function properly. The data is collected when you record a video.

How do we use your data?
We use your data to make the video accesible with a shareable url.

How do we store your data?
The data is stored in an AWS s3 bucket and some metadata is stored in the dynamodb.

How do we share your data?
We will never transfer, sell, make copies, or share any of your data stored by the application to third party services or companies unless strictly necessary to enable the application to function properly. Accordingly, personal data will be disclosed to third parties on a strictly limited 'need to know' basis where there is clear justification for transferring Personal Data - either because the Data Subject has consented to the transfer or because disclosure is required to perform a contract to which the Data Subject is a party, or for a legitimate purpose that does not infringe the Data Subject's fundamental rights, including the right to privacy (e.g. sharing in the context of a merger and acquisition operation).
